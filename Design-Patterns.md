# Design Patterns

> "Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice"

### Strategy;
Defines a family of algorithms encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independetly from clients that use it.

---

### Observer;
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all it's dependents are notified and updated automatically.

---

### Decorator;
Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

---

### Factory Method;
Define an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

---

### Abstract Factory;
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

---

### Singleton;
Ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

--

### Command;
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

---

### Adapter;
Converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expects. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

---

### Facade;
Provides an unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

---

### Templaste Method;
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
